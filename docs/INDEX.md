## 📖 Planning & Strategy

### [PRD.md](planning/PRD.md) - Product Requirements Document
**Purpose**: Define product vision, target users, and feature roadmap

**Key Sections**:
- Vision: "Cognitive Efficiency" through brain-aligned reading mechanics
- Core UX Principles (Focal Point is Sacred, Rhythm > Raw Speed)
- Persona Deep-Dives (Skeptic, Content Crusher, Savorer)
- Feature prioritization based on Comprehension Checkpoints
- Success metrics
- Competitive analysis

**Use when**: Making product decisions, prioritizing features, understanding "why"

---

### [use-cases.md](planning/use-cases.md) - Comprehensive Use Cases
**Purpose**: Explore UX workflows for different content types

**Key Sections**:
- 📚 **Books Mode**: Sarah reading with annotations and persistent position
- 📧 **Email Mode**: David's "Focus Inbox" with triage and quick replies
- 🐦 **Social Mode**: Emma's time-boxed Twitter deck interface
- 📄 **Work Docs Mode**: Jessica scanning contracts with keyword stops
- 🎧 **Podcast Mode**: Mike's transcript speedrun
- 🌐 **Browser Extension**: Anna's research queue workflow

**Philosophy**: *The moat isn't speed - it's understanding that reading isn't atomic*

**Use when**: Designing new features, understanding user journeys, scoping future work

---

### [brainstorm-input-sources.md](planning/brainstorm-input-sources.md) - Input Strategy
**Purpose**: Explore how Focus Reader becomes the universal reading interface

**Key Ideas**:
- The moat is in the ingest
- Social media as anti-doomscroll tool
- Email deep-dive: "Focus Inbox" concept
- Browser extension as fastest path to "read anything"
- Revenue model (Free = paste, Pro = integrations)

**Key Insight**: Speed reading tech is commoditized. Input pipeline is the differentiator.

**Use when**: Planning integrations, exploring new content sources, pitching the product
