> A second phenomenon of practice is the simplification of the conscious

> § 11. FATIGUE
> The conditions of fatigue are similar to those of practice. Fatigue
> occurs when mental functions are repeated too many times in immediate
> succession. But the result is not perfection, but deterioration of the
> performance. The sensitivity for weak stimuli or small differences of
> stimuli disappears. Attention is decreased, that is, fewer mental states

> consciousness. Reproduction, as in the processes of reading and
> arithmetic, is slow and inaccurate. Action becomes slow and awkward, and
> may cease altogether.
> Fatigue is obviously a protective measure. When the continued
> performance of a task threatens to exhaust the organs, their resistance
> to the call for action increases, and finally they completely refuse to
> respond. Because of the continuity of all organic processes, this
> refusal in extreme cases is impossible without a lesser degree of
> refusal before the extreme is reached. The first indications of fatigue
> thus appear soon after a prolonged mental activity has begun, as a
> diminution of the effects of practice. This leads often to the
> astonishing consequence that a certain performance is executed better at
> the beginning of a practice period than at the end of the preceding
> period. The acquired practice is then still effective, while the effect
> of fatigue is absent. This experience does not justify the conclusion
> that skill has increased during the time of intermission.
> Because of the great importance of fatigue for mental and bodily health,
> numerous investigators have in recent years undertaken to study it more
> closely by experimental methods. Especially fatigue caused by school
> work has been much under discussion in scientific and popular
> periodicals and even in the daily press. Little progress, however, has

---

> therefore subject to control and modification.
> =Attention.= Attention, too, is related to inherited tendencies on the one
> side and to habits on the other. If one is walking in the woods and
> catches a glimpse of something moving in the trees, the eyes
> _instinctively_ turn so that the person can get a better view of the

> that the person can hear better. One stops, the body is held still and
> rigid, breathing is slow and controlled--all to favor better hearing.
> The various acts of attention are reflex and instinctive. But what is
> attention? By attention we mean _sensory clearness_. When we say we are
> attentive to a thing or subject, we mean that perceptions or ideas of
> that thing or subject are _clear_ as compared to other perceptions and

---

> any one moment are always arranged in an _attentive_ pattern, some
> being clear, others unclear. The pattern constantly changes and shifts.
> What is now clear and in the focus of consciousness, presently is
> unclear and may in a moment disappear from consciousness altogether,
> while other perceptions or ideas take its place.
> The first question that arises in connection with attention is, What are
> the causes of attention? The first group of causes are hereditary and
> instinctive. The child attends to loud things, bright things, moving
> things, etc. But as we grow older, the basis of attention becomes more
> and more _habit_. An illustration will make this clear. I once spent a
> day at a great exposition with a machinist. He was constantly attending
> to things mechanical, when I would not even see them. He had spent many

---

> dresses, ribbons, and other finery, while the man sees only cigars,
> pipes, and automobile supplies. Every day we live, we are building up

---

> become focal and persist.
> =Training the Attention.= There are two aspects of the training of

> The young child cannot do this. He must be trained to do it. The

> important than this, for it gives him control over his life, it gives
> him control over the ideas that are to become focal and determine
> action. It is for this reason that we call such training a training of

> the will is only the attentive consciousness. The idea that is clear,

> (2) The training just discussed may be called a general training of
> attention giving us a general power and control over our lives, but

> perceptions related to one's chosen work go at once and readily to the

> It is for this reason that we become "crankier" every year that we live.
> We are attending to only one aspect of the world. While this blinds us
> to other aspects of the world, it brings mastery in our individual
> fields. We can, then, by training and practice, get a general control
> over attention, and by working in a certain field or kind of work, we
> make it easy to attend to things in that field or work. This to an
> extent gives us control of our lives, of our destiny.
> =Interest.= The essential elements of interest are attention and feeling.
> When a person is very attentive to a subject and gets pleasure from
> experience in that subject, we commonly say that he is _interested_ in
> that subject.
> Since the importance of attention and feeling in learning has already
> been shown and will be further developed in the chapters which follow in
> connection with the subjects of habit, memory, and thinking, little more
> need be said here.
> The key to all forms of learning is _attention_. The key to attention is
> _feeling_. Feeling depends upon the nature of the child, inherited and
> acquired. In our search for the means of arousing interest, we look
> first to the original nature of the child, to the instincts and the
> emotions. We look next to the acquired nature, the habits, the ideals,

> nature. We should not ask so much what a child's needs are, but what

> would have been somewhat less. Practice, then, not only develops speed
> but also develops accuracy.
> There are also other results. At the beginning of work with the

> energy comes from using unnecessary muscles, and the fatigue is partly
> due to this waste of energy. But even apart from this waste of energy,

> When one is learning to do a new trick, the attention cannot be divided.
> The whole mind must be devoted to the work. But after one has practiced

> Now that we have shown the results of habituation let us consider

> note on the keyboard. Moreover, we make many mistakes; we strike the
> wrong keys just as we do in typewriting. We are awkward, making many
> unnecessary movements, and the work is tiresome and fatiguing. After
> long practice, the speed with which we can manipulate the keys in
> playing the piano is wonderful. Our playing becomes accurate, perfect.
> We do it with ease, with no unnecessary movements. We can play the
> piano, after we become skilled, without paying attention to the actual
> movements of our hands. We can play the piano while concentrating upon

> Nailing shingles on a roof illustrates well the various aspects of
> habituation. The expert carpenter not only nails on many more shingles
> in a day than does the amateur, but he does it better and with more
> ease, and with much less fatigue. The carpenter knows exactly how much
> he can do in a day, and each particular movement is certain and sure.
> The carpenter has confidence in, and usually prides himself on, this
> ability, thus getting pleasure out of his work.
> The operations in arithmetic illustrate most of the results of
> habituation. Practice in addition makes for speed and accuracy. In a few
> weeks' time we can very much increase our speed and accuracy in adding,
> or in the other arithmetical operations.
> The foregoing examples are sufficient, although they could be multiplied

> =How Habits Are Formed.= It is clear from the foregoing discussion that
> the essential thing in a habit is the definiteness of the connection
> between the stimulus and the response, between the situation and the
> reaction to the situation. Our question now is, how is this definiteness
> of connection established? The answer is, _through repetition_. Let us
> work the matter out from a concrete case, such as learning to play the
> piano. In piano playing the stimulus comes from the music as printed on

---

> keys on the piano correspond to the various notes on the staff, or we
> may learn these facts from the instruction book. It makes no difference
> how we learn them; but after we know these facts, we must have practice
> to give us skill. The mere knowledge will not make us piano players. In
> order to be skillful, we must have much practice not only in striking
> the keys indicated by the various note positions, but with the various
> combinations of notes. For example, a note on the second space indicates
> that the player must strike the key known as "A." But "A" may occur with
> any of the other notes, it may precede them or it may follow them. We
> must therefore have practice in striking "A" in all these situations. To
> have skill at the piano, we must mechanize many performances. We must be
> able to read the notes with accuracy and ease. We must practice so much
> that the instant we see a certain combination of notes on the staff, our
> hands immediately execute the proper strokes. Not only must we learn

---

> Briefly, in piano playing, the stimulus comes from the characters
> printed on the staff. The movements which these characters direct are
> very complicated and require months and years of practice. We must
> emphasize the fact that practice alone gives facility, years of
> practice. But after these years of practice, one can play a piece of
> music at sight; that is, the first stimulus sets off perfectly a very
> complicated response. This sort of performance is one of the highest
> feats of skill that man accomplishes.
> To get skill, then, one must practice. But mere repetition is not
> sufficient. For practice to be most effective, one must put his whole
> mind on what he is doing. If he divides his attention between the acts
> which he is practicing and something else, the effect of the practice in
> fixing and perfecting the habit is slight. It seems that when we are
> building up a new nerve-path which is to be the basis of a new habit,
> the nervous energies should not be divided; that the whole available
> nervous energy should be devoted to the acts which we are repeating.
> This is only another way of saying that when we are practicing to
> establish a habit, we should attend to what we are doing and to nothing

> action will go on of itself. We may say, then, that in order to be able
> to do a thing with little or no attention, we must give much attention
> to it at first.
> Another important factor in habit-formation is pleasure. The act which
> we are practicing must give us pleasure, either while we are doing it or
> as a result. Pleasurable results hasten habit-formation. When we
> practice an act in which we have no interest, we make slow progress or
> none at all. Now the elements of interest are attention and pleasure. If
> we voluntarily attend to a thing and its performance gives us pleasure,
> or pleasure results from it, we say we are interested in it. The secret
> of successful practice is interest. Repeatedly in laboratory experiments
> it happens that a student loses interest in the performance and
> subsequently makes little, if any, progress. One of the biggest problems
> connected with habit-formation is that of maintaining interest.
> A factor which prevents the formation of habits is that of exceptions.
> If a stimulus, instead of going over to the appropriate response,
> produces some other action, there is an interference in the formation of
> the desired habit. The effect of an exception is greater than the mere
> neglect of practice. The _exception opens up another path_ and tends to
> make future action uncertain. Particularly is this true in the case of
> moral habits. Forming moral habits is usually uphill work anyway, in
> that we have instincts to overcome. Allowing exceptions to enter, in the
> moral sphere, usually means a slipping back into an old way of acting,
> thereby weakening much the newly-made connection.
> In any kind of practice, when we become fatigued we make errors. If we
> continue to practice when fatigued, we form connections which we do not

> =Economy of Practice.= The principles which we have enumerated and
> illustrated are fairly general and of universal validity. There are
> certain other factors which we may discuss here under the head of
> economical procedure. To form a habit, we must practice. But how long
> should we practice at one time? This is an experimental problem and has
> been definitely solved. It has been proved by experiment that we can
> practice profitably for as long a time as we can maintain a high degree
> of attention, which is usually till we become fatigued. This time is not
> the same for all people. It varies with age, and in the case of the same
> person it varies at different times. If ordinary college students work
> at habit-formation at the highest point of concentration, they get the
> best return for a period of about a half hour. It depends somewhat on
> the amount of concentration required for the work and the stage of
> fixation of the habit, _i.e._ whether one has just begun to form the
> habit or whether it is pretty well fixed. For children, the period of
> successful practice is usually much less than a half hour--five, ten,
> fifteen, twenty minutes, depending upon the age of the child and the
> kind of work.
> The best interval between periods of practice is the day, twenty-four
> hours. If one practices in the morning for a half hour, one can practice
> again in the afternoon with nearly as much return as he would secure the
> next day, but not quite. In general, practice is better, gives more
> return, if spread out. To practice one day as long as one can work at a
> high point of efficiency, and then to postpone further practice till the
> next day, gives one the most return for the time put in. But if one is
> in a hurry to form a habit, one can afford to practice more each day
> even if the returns from the practice do diminish proportionately.
> This matter has been tried out on the typewriter. If one practices for
> ten half hours a day with half-hour rests between, one does not get so
> much return for his time as he would if he should spread it out at the
> rate of one or two half-hour practices a day. But by working ten half
> hours a day, one gets much more efficiency in the same number of days
> than if he should practice only one or two half hours a day. This point
> must not be misunderstood. We do not mean that one must not work at
> anything longer than a half hour a day. We mean that if one is forming a
> habit, his time counts for more in forming the habit if spread out at
> the rate of a half hour or an hour a day, than it does if put in at a
> faster rate. Therefore if one is in no hurry and can afford to spread
> out his time, he gets the best return by so doing, and the habit is more
> firmly fixed than if formed hurriedly. But if one is in a hurry, and has
> the time to devote to it, he can afford to concentrate his practice up
> to five hours or possibly more in a day, provided that rest intervals
> are interspersed between periods of practice.
> There is one time in habit-formation when concentrated practice is most
> efficient. That is at the beginning. In a process as complicated as
> typewriting, so little impression is made at the beginning by a short
> period of practice that progress is but slight. On the first day, one
> should practice about four or five times to secure the best returns, a
> half hour each time.
> =What the Teacher Can Do.= Now, let us see how the teacher can be of
> assistance to the pupil in habit-formation. The teacher should have a
> clear idea of the nature of the habit to be formed and should
> demonstrate the habit to the pupil. Suppose the habit is so simple a

> process. She should go to the blackboard and actually solve a number of

---

> children to work a few problems while she watches for mistakes,
> correcting them at once, the teacher secures economy of effort and time.
> The first step is to demonstrate the habit to the pupils; the second, to
> have them do the act, whatever it is, correcting their mistakes; the
> third, to require the pupils to practice till they have acquired skill.
> The teacher must make provision for practice.
> =What Parents Can Do.= Parents can be of very great assistance to children
> who are forming habits.
> (1) They can coöperate with the school, which is directing the child in
> the systematic formation of a great system of habits. The teacher should
> explain these habits to the parents so that they may know what the
> teacher is trying to do. Quite often the home and the school are working
> at cross purposes. The only way to prevent this is for them to work in
> the closest coöperation, with the fullest understanding of what is being
> undertaken for the child. Parents and teachers should often meet
> together and talk over the work of training the children of the
> community. Parents should have not merely a general understanding of the
> work of the school, but they should know the details undertaken. The
> school often assigns practice work to be done at home in reading,
> writing, arithmetic. Parents should always know of these assignments and
> should help the children get the necessary practice. They can do this by
> reminding the child of the work, by preparing a suitable place where the
> work may be done, and by securing quiet for the practice. Children like
> play and it is easy for them to forget their necessary work. Parents can
> be of the greatest service to childhood and youth by holding the

---

> possible for their school progress. Few of those who do, make definite

> practice and study. This is the parent's duty and responsibility.
> Moreover, parents are likely to feel that children have no rights, and
> think nothing of calling on them in the midst of their work to do some
> errand. Now, children should work about the house and help their
> parents, but there should be a time for this and a separate time for
> study and practice on school work.
> When a child sits down for serious practice on some work, his time
> should be sacred and inviolable. Instead of interfering with the child,
> the parents should do everything in their power to make this practice
> possible and efficient. In their relations with their children perhaps

> any other way. They plan for everything else, but they let their
> children grow up, having taken no definite thought about helping them to
> form their life habits and to establish these habits by practice. When a
> child comes home from school, the mother should find out just what work

>   SUMMARY. Habits are acquired tendencies to specific actions in
>   definite situations. They are fixed through repetition. They give us
>   speed, accuracy, and certainty, they save energy and prevent
>   fatigue. They are performed with less attention and become
>   pleasurable. The main purpose of education is to form the
>   habits--moral, intellectual, vocational, cultural--necessary for
>   life. Habits and ideals are the basis of our mature life and
>   character. Moral training is essentially like other forms of
>   training, habit being the basis.
> CLASS EXERCISES
> 1. Practice on the formation of some habit until considerable skill is

> transcribe numbers into the letters as described on page 192. Keep a
> record of successive five-minute periods of practice till all have
> practiced an hour. This gives twelve practice periods for the
> construction of a learning curve. The individual experiments should be

>   SUMMARY. Sensation and perception give us our first experience with
>   things; memory is revived experience. It enables us to live our
>   experience over again and is therefore one of the most important
>   human traits. The physiological basis of memory is in the brain and
>   nervous system. Memory improves with practice and up to a certain
>   point with the age of the person. It is better in girls than in
>   boys. Good memory depends on vivid experience in the first place and
>   on organization and repetition afterward. The person who learns
>   quickly usually retains well also. Memory training is specific. The
>   extension of the learning process over a long time is favorable to
>   memory. Memory ideas are the basis of thinking and reasoning.
> CLASS EXERCISES
> 1. The teacher can test the auditory memory of the members of the class
> for rote material by using letters. It is better to omit the vowels,
> using only the consonants. Prepare five groups of letters with eight
> letters in a group. Read each group of letters to the class, slowly and
> distinctly. After reading a group, allow time for the students to write
> down what they recall, then read the next group and so proceed till the
> five groups have been read. Grade the work by finding the number of
> letters reproduced, taking no account of the position of the letters.
> 2. In a similar way, test visual memory, using different combinations of
> letters. Write the letters plainly on five large squares of cardboard.
> Hold each list before the class for as long a time as it took to read a
> group in experiment No. 1.
> 3. Test memory for words in a similar way. Use simple words of one
> syllable, making five lists with eight words in a list.
> 4. Test memory for objects by fastening common objects on a large
> cardboard and holding the card before the class. Put eight objects on
> each card and prepare five cards. Expose them for the same length of
> time as in experiment No. 2.
> 5. Test memory for _names_ of objects by preparing five lists of names,
> eight names in a list, and reading the names as in experiment No. 1.

> each student in all the above experiments. Do the members of the class
> hold the same rank in all the tests? How do the boys compare with the
> girls? How does memory for objects compare with memory for names of
> objects? How does auditory memory compare with visual? What other points
> do you learn from the experiments?
> 7. The teacher can make a study of the logical memory of the members of
> the class by using material as described on page 184. Make five separate
> tests, using stories that are well within the comprehension of the class
> and that will arouse their interest. Sufficient material will be found
> in the author's _Examination of School Children_ and Whipple's _Manual_.
> However, the teacher can prepare similar material.
> 8. Do the students maintain the same rank in the separate tests of
> experiment No. 7? Rank all the students for their combined standing in
> all the first five tests. Rank them for their combined standing in the
> logical memory tests. Compare the two rankings. What conclusions are
> warranted?
> 9. You have tested, in experiment No. 7, logical memory when the
> material was read to the students. It will now be interesting to compare
> the results of No. 7 with the results obtained by allowing the students
> to read the material of the test. For this purpose, select portions from

> tests, if there is sufficient time. Find the average grade of each
> student, and compare the results with those obtained in No. 7. This will

---

> material that can be easily prepared, such as lists of common words. Let
> the members of the class plan the experiment. Use the best plan.
> 11. The class can make a study of the relation of memory to school
> standing in one of the grades below the high school. Give at least two
> tests for logical memory. Give also the rote memory tests described on
> page 189. Get the class standing of the pupils from the teacher. Make

> (1) _Original experience._ Before reasoning in any field, one must have
